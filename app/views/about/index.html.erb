Congratulations, you played yourself. 
Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel.
The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. 
Take this journey with me, Lion! It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. 
I pick my choice, squeaky clean. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. 
Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success.

They never said winning was easy. 
Some people can’t handle success, I can. 
Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key,
Lion! In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, 
take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. 
The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, 
very important, major key, cloth talk.
Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow.</p>
